    "My mum is an artist, and my dad is an engineer. My brain loves working in both of those spaces at the same time. Yep, I love blending left-brain logic with right-brain creativity—front-end development with an eye for artistry.",
    "I spent years working in graphic design and studying fine art (yes, even tapestry!) before finally finding my forever home in front-end development.",
    "I grew up in a tiny town called Bridgwater in England—it's missing an “e” because the Vikings stole it (really!).",
    "Just as I was about to dive into digital design, I ended up managing 13 people in one of the busiest, high-end pubs in London. And I was stinkin' good at it. Oh, and I was also head chef—grilling every steak—while leading that crew under the hottest heat in the business.",
    "When I moved to the U.S., I felt right at home. California was a bit too sunny, but the Pacific Northwest? Just right. I met my wife, Jess, and we've been giggling together for 15 years. Our kiddos, pups, and kitty just add to the fun.",
    "I've done a lot of interesting work, but now it's time to find a role that truly fits all my skills and passions."
